Haskell was born functional. I find that functional programming in Haskell looks more succint than in Scala, which is also functional langauge. But Scala was born on top of java to extend functional features. So, Scala is more like hybrid language of object oriented and functioanl features. It means that Scala has OOP, functional, strict, lazy, mutable, immutable, so many features. It all depends on how scala users utilize it.</description>

This scala capstone project is the last course of the Functional Programming in Scala Specialization Series from Coursera. This writing is about my implementation solution of the project, with a little bit of mathmatical model and performance measurements of the project. This project is composed of 6 milestones to implement a complete application which processes and mathmatically compute a lot of weather data, and then shows interactive visualization of the evolutionary temperatures around the world over time on the web, like image below.</description>
